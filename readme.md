# unimelb-COMP90082-SP-Backend
This is the backend for COMP90082 SP project.
It provides REST apis for students activities data on Confluence, Jira, and Git.


## Management of branches and releases

In Semester 2, 2021, in order to make it easier to distinguish from the previous work, there is an instruction of branch and release management.

Branch management is composed of the following parts:

sm2-demo is a demo for running in local environments. It is updated by Yixiao Zhang.

sm2-jira is the branch of new features on Jira part. It is updated by Yixiao Zhang.

sm2-git is the branch of new features on Git part. It is updated by Shisheng Liu.

sm2_confluence is the branch of new features on Confluence part. It is updated by Yalan Zhao.

## Deploy methods

**require python3.7 or higher and MySQL**

**For the first time to run the system:**
1. Install all packages needed `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if python2 and python3 are both installed, use pip3 and python3)
2. start MySQL server on localhost:3306, and create a database named "sp90013" `CREATE DATABASE sp90013`
3. modify the MySQL username and password config in TeamSPBackend/Settings/dev.py and TeamSPBackend/Settings/prod.py (don't forget to modify 'DATABASES/default/TEST/PASSWORD' in prod.py)
4. create MySQL tables: first `python manage.py makemigrations`, then `python manage.py migrate`
5. start server `python manage.py runserver`
6. api web server is now running on: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1
7. This project uses Understand for analyze Metrics.Please install Understand and change UND_PATH in github_util.py

**For the second time to run the system:**
1. start server `python manage.py runserver`
2. Open the front-end
3. Wait until a new page jump out in the browser. Please logout and login again if you found you are not at the login page

### Structuring files

To create new APIs or extend existing ones, kindly put the API endpoints (URLs) in "TeamSPBackend/api/urls_vX.py" (for version X) with their corresponding API functions. Kindly refer to "TeamSPBackend/api/urls_v1.py" for more info.

The functions called by the API endpoints are created and reside in "TeamSPBackend/api/views". For example, the functions related to any Team APIs reside in "TeamSpBackendd/api/views/team.py". The functions for Confluence and JIRA APIs reside in their own sub-folders ("TeamSPBackend/api/views/confluence" & "TeamSPBackend/api/views/jira") as they are comprised of multiple files.

The database models for the objects used in our APIs are written as modules of their own in "TeamSPBackend".

To create new models and/or APIs utilizing them, kindly follow the current directory structure and format:

- Database models in its own module. E.g. "TeamSPBackend/newModel/" containing the files "app.py" and "models.py"
- Functions for new APIs under "TeamSPBackend/api/views/". E.g. "TeamSPBackend/api/views/newModel.py"
- API endpoints (URLs) in "TeamSPBackend/api/urls_vX.py" for version X
- For any API functions that require multiple files, put those files under a sub-folder in "TeamSPBackend/api/views/". E.g. "TeamSPBackend/api/views/newModel/"

### Some solution for the problems
1. When you first run the system or add a project, it would take a few minutes for the system to get information from API, store these information into the database and show these information on the page. So please wait until the back-end part do not jump out new log. Then you can add new project or do other operations.
2. Sometimes the system may do not respond for a long time, you can try some solutions in the following order(If one of them work, you do not need to try the later one):
    - Go back to the home page and click into the project again
    - Go back to the home page and delete the project that do not respond. Then search for the same project and add it again.
    - Log out and try to login again.
    - Close the back-end and front-end and try to run again from the beginning.
    - Close the back-end and front-end, clearing the cache of the browser you use to open the system and try to run back-end and front-end again from the beginning.
    - If all the solutions listed above could not work, please leave a comment on this git page.
3. There are some team members from previous semester are graduated and their information is not stored in the confluence system. So you could just ignore the log information which tells you the user do not exist. 
4. Not all the project have JIRA or confluence comment information, so some table could be blank.
